	{"text": "You can move your character by pressing A and D for the left and right directions. Try it out!"}
	{"text": "You can also press E to punch and Q to kick. Try that out too!"}
	{"text": "See that red bar on the top of the screen? That's your health, don't let your enemy drop you life all the way down, or else, you will lose!"}
	{"text": "But, your enemy also has his own health, so if you want to win, make sure that you beat him up!"}
	{"text": "Also see that timer? That's the time of the battle, if it ends, the round of the battle is over. If the round is over and no one has been defeated, the character with less health wins."}
	{"text": "And you're all set! Try beating up your enemy on a real battle now!"}
